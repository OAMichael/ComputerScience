# Inotify

### There are two versions of Inotify programs. 

#### `10-Inotify.exe` watches entered directory (or working directory by default) and displays information about creating, deleting, accessing, opening and modifying files. But it may become too messy, so there is another version `10-Inotify_CRT_DEL.exe` which watches only creating and deleting files.
