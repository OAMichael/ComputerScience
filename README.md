Every task has its number. Except XtrCopy - this one corresponds to task number 3*.

The last one (5fchown) can easily copy GID information, but there are some problems with copying UID. It can be copied only if program run with
particular permissions (I mean for example  sudo ./5fchown First.txt Second.txt).
